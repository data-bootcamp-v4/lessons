<!-- # SQL Temporary tables, Views and CTEs Hands On -->

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
 
- Understand and create temporary tables in SQL.
- Distinguish between permanent and temporary tables.

## Case study: Guide to the Financial Data Set

We'll continue with the Finantial Data Set.

For more details about the relations and the attribute descriptions, please refer to the previous lesson or the pdf document [`case_study_extended.pdf`](https://github.com/data-bootcamp-v4/lessons/blob/main/4_sql/files_for_lessons/case_study_extended.pdf).

## **Practice with SQL Queries**

Use MySQL (or your preferred SQL client) to access the 'bank' database, which will serve as the foundation for our upcoming examples.

Once you've successfully connected to MySQL and opened the database, proceed to open and examine [this SQL file with queries](https://github.com/data-bootcamp-v4/lessons/blob/main/4_sql/4.5_sql_temp_tables_views_ctes.sql). It contains a variety of SQL commands tailored for the 'bank' database, providing hands-on experience. Dive in and start exploring!

<!-- # SQL: Temporary Tables, Views, and CTEs -->

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Identify the characteristics and uses of temporary tables in SQL.
- Differentiate between permanent and temporary tables.
- Describe the benefits and basic structure of views in SQL.
- Construct and apply Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to achieve modular querying.

## Temporary Tables

Temporary tables, which exist only during a session or specific procedure, are short-lived structures ideal for storing intermediate results needed temporarily.
Temporary tables, which exist only during a session or specific procedure, are short-lived structures ideal for storing intermediate results needed temporarily.

### Basic Syntax

```sql
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_table_name (column1 datatype, column2 datatype, ...);
```

### Key Points

- **Duration**: Temporary tables are automatically deleted at the end of the session or procedure.
- **Scope**: They are only visible to the session that created them.
- **Naming**: While not mandatory, it's common to prefix temporary tables with `temp_` or use a similar convention for clarity.

### **Example**

Suppose we have the following table. 

**Table: employees**

| employee_name | salary  |
|---------------|---------|
| John Doe      | 60000   |
| Jane Smith    | 55000   |
| Lucy Liu      | 48000   |
| Alan Walker   | 52000   |

In order to create a temporary table to store top-earning employees, we can use the following query:
In order to create a temporary table to store top-earning employees, we can use the following query:

```sql
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE top_employees AS
SELECT employee_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000;
```

**Resulting Temporary Table: top_employees**

| employee_name | salary  |
|---------------|---------|
| John Doe      | 60000   |
| Jane Smith    | 55000   |
| Alan Walker   | 52000   |



## Views

A view is a virtual table based on the result set of a SQL statement. It does not store data physically but rather provides a way to access data from one or more tables in a simplified or aggregated manner.

### Basic Syntax

```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM tablename
WHERE condition;
```

### Key Points

- **Simplicity**: Views can abstract away the complexity of underlying table structures.
- **Security**: They can restrict access to specific rows or columns.
- **Consistency**: Views ensure consistent results for recurring queries.
- **Read-Only**: Most views are read-only, but some databases support "updatable views."

### **Example**

We'll continue using the table employees defined above. 
We'll continue using the table employees defined above. 

In order to create a view of employees with high salaries, we can use the following query:
In order to create a view of employees with high salaries, we can use the following query:

```sql
CREATE VIEW high_salary_employees AS
SELECT employee_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000;
```

**Resulting View: high_salary_employees**

| employee_name | salary  |
|---------------|---------|
| John Doe      | 60000   |
| Jane Smith    | 55000   |
| Alan Walker   | 52000   |


## Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

A CTE provides a temporary result set that can be referenced within a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement. CTEs make complex queries more readable and modular.

### Basic Syntax

```sql
WITH cte_name (column_name1, column_name2, ...) AS (
    SELECT statement
)
SELECT * FROM cte_name;
```
### Key Points

- **Readability**: CTEs structure and segment complex queries for better readability.
- **Recursion**: Some databases support recursive CTEs, enabling hierarchical or iterative querying.
- **Scope**: A CTE is only available to the query in which it is defined.

### **Example**

We'll continue with the table employees defined above. 

To calculate the average salary of employees using a CTE, we can use the following query:
To calculate the average salary of employees using a CTE, we can use the following query:

```sql
WITH avg_salary AS (
    SELECT AVG(salary) AS average
    FROM employees
)
SELECT employee_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT average FROM avg_salary);
```


**Resulting Set from CTE-based Query**

| employee_name | salary  |
|---------------|---------|
| John Doe      | 60000   |
| Jane Smith    | 55000   |

Note: The average salary is calculated to be 53,750. Therefore only employees with salaries greater than this amount will be listed in the resulting set.



## When to Use Which?

1. **Temporary Tables**: Use when you have large intermediate results that need to be referenced multiple times in various queries during a session.
2. **Views**: Use when you want a persistent "saved" query that abstracts away complexity or provides restricted access to data.
2. **Views**: Use when you want a persistent "saved" query that abstracts away complexity or provides restricted access to data.
3. **CTEs**: Use for breaking down complex queries into simpler parts for a single query execution, especially when recursion is involved.
4. **Subqueries**: Use for on-the-fly computations within a query when you don't need to reuse the result.

## Summary

Temporary tables, views, and CTEs are powerful SQL constructs that enhance flexibility, readability, and modularity in database querying. Whether you're simplifying complex queries with CTEs, abstracting database structure with views, or using temporary tables for transient data manipulation, understanding these concepts is crucial for advanced SQL operations.

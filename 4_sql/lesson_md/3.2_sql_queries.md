## Read tables with SELECT statement 

The most fundamental SQL command is the `SELECT` statement, which retrieves data from a database.

```sql
SELECT * FROM tablename;
```

This gets every row and column from the table *tablename*. The asterisk means "all the columns".

If we want to select just a few columns we would do:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM tablename;
```

### **Example**:

Suppose we have a table `students` with columns `id`, `name`, and `age`.

**Table `students`**:

| id | name     | age |
|----|----------|-----|
| 1  | Alice    | 20  |
| 2  | Bob      | 22  |
| 3  | Charlie  | 21  |
| 4  | David    | 23  |

To fetch all names from the `students` table:

```sql
SELECT name FROM students;
```

**Result**:

| name     |
|----------|
| Alice    |
| Bob      |
| Charlie  |
| David    |

## Select only the UNIQUE values

When querying data from a table, you may get duplicate rows. To remove these duplicate rows (to get unique values in the output), you use the `DISTINCT` clause in the `SELECT` statement.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT columnname
FROM tablename;
```

### **Example**:

**Table `students`** (same as above).To fetch unique ages from the `students` table:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT age FROM students;
```

**Result**:

| age |
|-----|
| 20  |
| 22  |
| 21  |
| 23  |

## Aggregate functions

To perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value, MySQL provides various aggregate functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`, and `MIN()`.

```sql
SELECT AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(columnname)
FROM tablename;
```

### **Example**:

**Table `students`** (same as above). 

To find the average age of students:

```sql
SELECT AVG(age) FROM students;
```

**Result**:

| AVG(age) |
|----------|
| 21.5     |

## ORDER BY

When you use the ```SELECT``` statement to query data from a table, the order of rows in the result set is unspecified. To sort the rows in the result set, you add the ```ORDER BY``` clause in the ```SELECT``` statement.

You can also specify the direction of the order by adding the command ```ASC``` or ```DESC```. 

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM tablename
ORDER BY columnname [ASC|DESC];
```

The `ORDER BY` clause in SQL allows you to sort the result set based on multiple columns. This is especially useful when you want to have a primary sort criterion and then a secondary sort criterion (and so on) for rows that have the same value in the primary sort column.

To sort the result set based on multiple columns:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM tablename
ORDER BY columnname1 [ASC|DESC], columnname2 [ASC|DESC], ...;
```

When using multiple columns in the `ORDER BY` clause:
1. The result set is first sorted by the first column.
2. If there are rows with duplicate values in the first column, the result set sorts those rows based on the second column, and so forth.

### **Example**:

**Table `students`**: same as before.

| id | name     | age |
|----|----------|-----|
| 1  | Alice    | 20  |
| 2  | Bob      | 22  |
| 3  | Charlie  | 21  |
| 4  | David    | 23  |

To fetch all student names ordered by age in descending order:

```sql
SELECT name FROM students ORDER BY age DESC;
```

In this case, the output will be sorted by age, so from the oldest to the youngest. 

**Result**:

| name     |
|----------|
| David    |
| Bob      |
| Charlie  |
| Alice    |

### **Example**:

Suppose we have the `students` table, and we want to order the students primarily by their age and then, for students of the same age, alphabetically by name.

```sql
SELECT name, age 
FROM students 
ORDER BY age DESC, name ASC;
```

In this example:

1. The result set is first sorted in descending order by age.
2. For students who have the same age, their names are then sorted in ascending alphabetical order.



## GROUP BY

The `GROUP BY` clause is an essential aspect of SQL, especially when you're working with aggregate functions.

The `GROUP BY` clause groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into aggregate data, such as the sum, average, minimum, maximum, etc. It's often used with aggregate functions to perform an operation on each group of rows.

```sql
SELECT column1, AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(column2)
FROM tablename
GROUP BY column1;
```

### **Key Points**:

1. **Grouping**: When using `GROUP BY`, the data is divided into groups based on the values in the specified column(s). Each group represents one or more rows of the table.
   
2. **Aggregate Functions**: Once the data is grouped, you can use an aggregate function (like `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, etc.) to perform a calculation on each group. The result is a single value per group.

3. **Multiple Columns**: You can group by more than one column by listing multiple column names separated by commas. This creates groups based on the unique combinations of values in the specified columns.

### **Example**:

Suppose we have a table `sales` with columns `product`, `region`, `amount_sold` and `year`.

**Table: sales**

| product | region | amount_sold | year |
|---------|--------|-------------|------|
| A       | North  | 100         | 2020 |
| A       | South  | 50          | 2020 |
| B       | North  | 60          | 2020 |
| B       | South  | 40          | 2020 |
| A       | North  | 90          | 2021 |
| B       | South  | 70          | 2021 |

To find out the total sales amount for each product:

```sql
SELECT product, SUM(amount_sold) as total_sold
FROM sales
GROUP BY product;
```

**Resulting Table**:

| product | total_sold |
|---------|------------|
| A       | 240        |
| B       | 170        |


### **Example**:

To find out the total sales amount for each product in each region:

```sql
SELECT product, region, SUM(amount_sold) as total_sold
FROM sales
GROUP BY product, region;
```

**Resulting Table**:

| product | region | total_sold |
|---------|--------|------------|
| A       | North  | 190        |
| A       | South  | 50         |
| B       | North  | 60         |
| B       | South  | 110        |

## WHERE clause for filtering data

The `WHERE` clause is a fundamental part of SQL that allows you to filter records based on specific conditions, ensuring that only certain rows are selected or affected by a SQL statement.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM tablename
WHERE condition;
```

### **Key Points**:

1. **Conditions**: The condition in the `WHERE` clause can involve comparisons using operators like `=`, `<>` or `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`. 

2. **Logical Operators**: You can combine multiple conditions using logical operators like `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`.

3. **Functions and Expressions**: The `WHERE` clause can also contain functions, arithmetic calculations, and other expressions.

### **Example**:

Using the `sales` table with columns `product`, `region`, `amount_sold`, and `year`:

**Table: sales**

| product  | region | amount_sold | year |
|----------|--------|-------------|------|
| Laptop   | East   | 100         | 2022 |
| Phone    | West   | 150         | 2022 |
| Laptop   | West   | 80          | 2022 |
| Laptop   | North  | 90          | 2021 |
| Phone    | South  | 70          | 2021 |

To fetch all sales records for the product "Laptop":

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM sales
WHERE product = 'Laptop';
```

**Resulting Table**:

| product  | region | amount_sold | year |
|----------|--------|-------------|------|
| Laptop   | East   | 100         | 2022 |
| Laptop   | West   | 80          | 2022 |
| Laptop   | North  | 90          | 2021 |

### Example

To fetch sales records for the product "Laptop" in the region "West" during the year 2022:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM sales
WHERE product = 'Laptop' AND region = 'West' AND year = 2022;
```


**Resulting Table**:

| product  | region | amount_sold | year |
|----------|--------|-------------|------|
| Laptop   | West   | 80          | 2022 |

When combined with other SQL clauses, the order of operation is essential:

1. The `WHERE` clause filters the rows on the given condition.
2. If there's a `GROUP BY` clause, the filtered rows are then grouped.
3. Aggregate functions are applied.
4. The `HAVING` clause filters the groups (if present) - we will explain this below -.
5. Finally, the `ORDER BY` clause sorts the result set.

For instance, using the `sales` table:

To get the total sales amount for each product in 2022:

```sql
SELECT product, SUM(amount_sold) as total_sold
FROM sales
WHERE year = 2022
GROUP BY product;
```

In this example, the `WHERE` clause first filters out the records not from the year 2022. The remaining records are then grouped by product, and the total sales amount for each product is computed.

**Resulting Table**:

| product  | total_sold |
|----------|------------|
| Laptop   | 180        |
| Phone    | 150        |


## HAVING clause

The `HAVING` clause is a special clause in SQL that allows you to filter the result sets of a query after they have been grouped by a `GROUP BY` clause. It's specifically used to filter aggregate results.

While the `WHERE` clause filters rows before they're aggregated, the `HAVING` clause filters after the aggregation.

```sql
SELECT column1, AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(column2)
FROM tablename
GROUP BY column1
HAVING condition;
```

### **Key Points**:

1. **Post-Aggregation Filtering**: The primary purpose of the `HAVING` clause is to allow filtering after the `GROUP BY` operation. This is particularly useful when you want to include/exclude certain groups based on an aggregate criterion.
  
2. **Works with Aggregate Functions**: Conditions in the `HAVING` clause often involve aggregate functions like `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, etc.

3. **Not a Substitute for WHERE**: It's important to note that `HAVING` isn't a replacement for the `WHERE` clause. Instead, they serve different purposes. If you need to filter individual rows before aggregation, use the `WHERE` clause.

### Example

Using the previously mentioned `sales` table with columns `product`, `region`, `amount_sold`, and `year`:

To get products that have a total sold amount greater than 500:

```sql
SELECT product, SUM(amount_sold) as total_sold
FROM sales
GROUP BY product
HAVING total_sold > 500;
```

In this example:

- The `GROUP BY` clause groups the sales by `product`.
- The `SUM(amount_sold)` calculates the total amount sold for each product.
- The `HAVING` clause then filters out groups (i.e., products) that have a total sold amount of 500 or less.

**Resulting Table**:

| product  | total_sold |
|----------|------------|
| Laptop   | 850        |
| Tablet   | 650        |


### **Combining with WHERE**:

You can use both `WHERE` and `HAVING` in the same query. Remember:

- `WHERE` filters rows before aggregation.
- `HAVING` filters groups after aggregation.

For instance:

To get the total sales amount for each product in 2022, but only include those products with a total sold amount greater than 500:

```sql
SELECT product, SUM(amount_sold) as total_sold
FROM sales
WHERE year = 2022
GROUP BY product
HAVING total_sold > 500;
```

In this example, the `WHERE` clause first filters out the records not from the year 2022. The remaining records are then grouped by product, the total sales amount for each product is computed, and finally, the `HAVING` clause filters out products that don't meet the sales threshold.

**Resulting Table**:

| product  | total_sold |
|----------|------------|
| Laptop   | 850        |

## LIMIT Clause

To limit the number of rows returned:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM tablename
LIMIT number;
```

### **Example**:

To fetch the first three sales:

```sql
SELECT * FROM sales LIMIT 3;
```

**Resulting Table**:

| product  | region | amount_sold | year |
|----------|--------|-------------|------|
| Laptop   | East   | 600         | 2022 |
| Phone    | West   | 300         | 2022 |
| Laptop   | West   | 250         | 2022 |

## CASE Expression in SQL

The `CASE` expression provides a way to introduce conditional decision-making logic directly within SQL queries. It's akin to "if-then-else" logic in other programming languages.

```sql
CASE
    WHEN condition1 THEN result1
    WHEN condition2 THEN result2
    ...
    ELSE result_else
END AS alias_name
```

- **WHEN**: Specifies a condition to check.
- **THEN**: Provides the result to be returned if the condition is true.
- **ELSE**: (Optional) Specifies the result to return if none of the `WHEN` conditions are met.
- **END**: Closes the `CASE` statement.
- **AS alias_name**: Gives a name to the new column formed as a result of the `CASE` expression.

### **Example with the `sales` table**:

Imagine we want to categorize products based on their `amount_sold`:

- High Sales: `amount_sold` greater than 10,000
- Moderate Sales: `amount_sold` between 5,000 and 10,000
- Low Sales: `amount_sold` less than 5,000

Using the `sales` table with columns `product`, `region`, `amount_sold`, and `year`:

```sql
SELECT product, region, amount_sold, year,
CASE 
    WHEN amount_sold > 10000 THEN 'High Sales'
    WHEN amount_sold >= 5000 AND amount_sold <= 10000 THEN 'Moderate Sales'
    ELSE 'Low Sales'
END AS sales_category
FROM sales;
```

In this example:

- The `CASE` expression evaluates each row's `amount_sold` value.
- Depending on the value, it categorizes the sales as either 'High Sales', 'Moderate Sales', or 'Low Sales'.
- The result of this categorization is displayed in a new column named `sales_category`.

**Resulting Table**:

| product  | region | amount_sold | year | sales_category |
|----------|--------|-------------|------|----------------|
| Laptop   | East   | 600         | 2022 | Low Sales      |
| Phone    | West   | 300         | 2022 | Low Sales      |
| Laptop   | West   | 250         | 2022 | Low Sales      |
| Tablet   | North  | 650         | 2021 | Low Sales      |

## **FORMAT Function in SQL**

The `FORMAT` function is primarily used to format numbers and dates to make them more readable or to adhere to specific local or business conventions.

### 1. **Formatting Numbers**

In MySQL, the `FORMAT` function is predominantly used with numbers to format a number with grouped thousands or to show it with a specific number of decimal places.

**Syntax**:
```sql
FORMAT(number, decimal_places, [locale])
```

- **number**: The number to be formatted.
- **decimal_places**: The number of decimal places to be returned.
- **locale** (optional): The locale to be used for formatting (e.g., 'en_US').

#### **Example**:

To format the number 1234567.89 to two decimal places with a comma as the thousand separator:
```sql
SELECT FORMAT(1234567.89, 2);  -- Returns '1,234,567.89'
```

### 2. **Formatting Dates**

While MySQL's `FORMAT` function isn't directly used for dates, other functions are available for date formatting, such as `DATE_FORMAT`.

**Syntax**:
```sql
DATE_FORMAT(date, format_specifiers)
```

- **date**: The date value to be formatted.
- **format_specifiers**: The format pattern using specific specifiers (e.g., `%Y` for year, `%m` for month, `%d` for day).

#### **Example**:

Assuming a table `sales` has a `sale_date` column:

**Table: sales with sale_date**

| product  | region | amount_sold | sale_date  |
|----------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Laptop   | East   | 600         | 2022-06-15 |
| Phone    | West   | 300         | 2022-09-20 |

If we want to format the date to display in the format "Month Day, Year", we can use:

```sql
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(sale_date, '%M %d, %Y') AS formatted_date
FROM sales;
```

**Resulting Table**:

| formatted_date  |
|-----------------|
| June 15, 2022   |
| September 20, 2022 |

### **Considerations for Other Databases**:

- **SQL Server**: The `FORMAT` function can be used for both numbers and dates. For example, `FORMAT(some_date, 'yyyy-MM-dd')` to format a date.
  
- **Oracle**: Oracle uses the `TO_CHAR` function for both number and date formatting. For instance, `TO_CHAR(some_date, 'YYYY-MM-DD')` for dates.

- **PostgreSQL**: PostgreSQL uses the `TO_CHAR` function similarly to Oracle for date and number formatting.


## SQL operators

SQL operators are symbols or keywords used to perform operations on data in SQL queries. They help manipulate and compare data, filter rows, and perform calculations. Here are some common types of SQL operators:


### Arithmetic Operators:

+ Addition +

- Subtraction -

* Multiplication *

- Division /

- Modulus (division remainder) % or MOD

### Comparison Operators:

- = Equal to

- != or <> Not equal to

- < Less than

- $\gt$ Greater than
 
- <= Less than or equal to

$\geq$ Greater than or equal to

### Logical Operators:

- AND: Logical AND

- OR: Logical OR

- NOT: Logical NOT

### Concatenation Operator:

- || or CONCAT(): Concatenates strings together

### Pattern Matching Operators:

- LIKE: Matches a pattern in text (supports wildcards)

- IN: Checks if a value exists in a list of values

### NULL Comparison Operators:

- IS NULL: Checks if a value is NULL

- IS NOT NULL: Checks if a value is not NULL

### Between Operator:

- BETWEEN: Checks if a value falls within a range



## Order of Writing and Executing SQL Clauses


**Order of Writing SQL Clauses**

The order in which you write SQL clauses and the order in which they are executed by the database engine are two different things. This distinction is important for understanding how SQL processes your requests.

When constructing an SQL statement, the clauses need to be written in a specific order:

1. `SELECT`
2. `FROM`
3. `WHERE`
4. `GROUP BY`
5. `HAVING`
6. `ORDER BY`
7. `LIMIT`

For example:

```sql
SELECT column1, AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(column2)
FROM tablename
WHERE condition_on_column
GROUP BY column1
HAVING condition_on_aggregated_column
ORDER BY column1
LIMIT number;
```

**Order of Execution of SQL Clauses**

The SQL engine does not execute clauses in the order they are written. Instead, it follows a specific sequence to process the data:

1. `FROM`: It identifies the table(s) from which data is to be retrieved.
2. `WHERE`: Filters the rows based on the condition specified. It acts on the result of the `FROM` clause.
3. `GROUP BY`: It groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into aggregate data.
4. `HAVING`: Filters the groups based on a condition. It acts on the result of the `GROUP BY` clause.
5. `SELECT`: Selects columns to be displayed in the final result. If there are any aggregate functions, they are computed here.
6. `ORDER BY`: Sorts the result set based on one or more columns.
7. `LIMIT`: Limits the number of rows to be returned in the result set.

### **Why This Matters**:

Understanding the order of execution is crucial for several reasons:

- **Predictability**: Knowing how SQL processes the data helps you predict the outcome of your queries. For instance, the `WHERE` clause filters rows before they're grouped by the `GROUP BY` clause.
  
- **Performance**: Optimizing the `WHERE` clause can significantly reduce the number of rows that need to be grouped, aggregated, or sorted in subsequent steps, leading to faster query performance.
  
- **Debugging**: If your query isn't returning what you expect, understanding the order of execution can help pinpoint where things are going awry.

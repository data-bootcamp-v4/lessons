<!-- # SQL Joins Hands On -->

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
 
- Understand different types of joins: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN), RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN), and FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN).
- Retrieve data from multiple tables based on common columns.
- Use the `ON` clause to specify conditions for the join.
- Utilize aliases for tables and columns.

## Case study: Guide to the Financial Data Set

We'll continue with the Finantial Data Set.

For more details about the relations and the attribute descriptions, please refer to the previous lesson or the pdf document [`case_study_extended.pdf`](https://github.com/data-bootcamp-v4/lessons/blob/main/4_sql/files_for_lessons/case_study_extended.pdf).

## **Practice with SQL Queries**

Use MySQL (or your preferred SQL client) to access the 'bank' database, which will serve as the foundation for our upcoming examples.

Once you've successfully connected to MySQL and opened the database, proceed to open and examine [this SQL file with queries](https://github.com/data-bootcamp-v4/lessons/blob/main/4_sql/4.3_sql_joins.sql). It contains a variety of SQL commands tailored for the 'bank' database, providing hands-on experience. Dive in and start exploring!

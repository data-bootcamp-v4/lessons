## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the concept of window functions and their utility.
- Learn how to apply various window functions in MySQL to perform calculations across sets of table rows related to the current row.
- Use different window frame specifications to refine calculations.
- Combine window functions with other SQL clauses for advanced data analysis.

## Introduction to Window Functions

Window functions, sometimes referred to as analytical or OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) functions, allow you to perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row, without collapsing groups of rows into a single output row like an aggregate function does. They operate within a "window" of rows defined by the `OVER` clause.


### Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2,
       WINDOW_FUNCTION(column3) OVER (
           PARTITION BY column4
           ORDER BY column5
           [window_frame_clause]
       ) AS alias_name
FROM tablename;
```

1. **PARTITION BY**: Divides the result set into partitions (groups) to which the window function is applied. Think of it as a way to apply the window function to "subgroups" of your result set.
2. **ORDER BY**: Defines an order within each partition.
3. **Frame Specification**: Defines which rows are included in the window to be processed by the window function relative to the current row.

### Common Window Functions

#### 1. **ROW_NUMBER()**

Assigns a unique sequential integer to each row within its partition.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY column3) AS row_num
FROM tablename;
```

**Example:**

Imagine a table `sales` with columns `date`, `salesperson_id`, and `sales_amount`.


| date       | salesperson_id | sales_amount |
|------------|----------------|--------------|
| 2023-09-01 | 1              | 100          |
| 2023-09-02 | 1              | 150          |
| 2023-09-01 | 2              | 200          |

To assign a unique sequential number to each sale made by each salesperson ordered by date:

```sql
SELECT date, salesperson_id, sales_amount,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY salesperson_id ORDER BY date) as row_num
FROM sales;
```

The result would be:

| date       | salesperson_id | sales_amount | row_num |
|------------|----------------|--------------|---------|
| 2023-09-01 | 1              | 100          | 1       |
| 2023-09-02 | 1              | 150          | 2       |
| 2023-09-01 | 2              | 200          | 1       |

This query provides a row number for each sale entry, partitioned by each salesperson and ordered by the date of sale. Let's break it down:

1. **Selection**:
2. 
```sql
SELECT date, salesperson_id, sales_amount
```
This part of the query selects the `date`, `salesperson_id`, and `sales_amount` columns from the `sales` table.

2. **Assigning Row Numbers with ROW_NUMBER()**:
3. 
```sql
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY salesperson_id ORDER BY date) as row_num
```

This is the core of the query. The `ROW_NUMBER()` function assigns a unique sequential integer to rows within a result set. The integer starts at 1 for the first row in each partition.

- `PARTITION BY salesperson_id`: This means that the row numbering will restart for each unique salesperson. So each salesperson will have their sales entries numbered from 1 onwards.
  
- `ORDER BY date`: This determines the sequence in which the row numbers will be assigned. In this case, sales are numbered based on the `date` in ascending order. The earliest sale for a salesperson will get a row number of 1, the next earliest sale will get 2, and so on.

3. **Result**:
The output will be a list of sales entries with an additional `row_num` column that indicates the row number of each sale for a particular salesperson, ordered by the date of sale.

#### 2. **RANK() and DENSE_RANK()**

AAssigns a unique rank to each distinct row, with the same rank assigned to rows with the same values. If two rows have the same rank, the next rank is skipped. `DENSE_RANK()` is similar to `RANK()`, but without skipping any ranks.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY column3) AS rank_num,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY column3) AS dense_rank_num
FROM tablename;
```

**Example**:

Suppose we have this table:

| salesperson_id | total_sales |
|----------------|-------------|
| 1              | 250         |
| 2              | 200         |
| 3              | 250         |


Lets calculate the total sales for each salesperson and then rank them based on the total sales in descending order.

```sql
SELECT salesperson_id, SUM(sales_amount) as total_sales,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(sales_amount) DESC) as rank,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(sales_amount) DESC) as dense_rank
FROM sales
GROUP BY salesperson_id;
```

The result would be:

| salesperson_id | total_sales | rank | dense_rank |
|----------------|-------------|------|------------|
| 1              | 250         | 1    | 1          |
| 3              | 250         | 1    | 1          |
| 2              | 200         | 3    | 2          |

1. **Selection and Grouping**:
```sql
SELECT salesperson_id, SUM(sales_amount) as total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY salesperson_id;
```
This part of the query groups the `sales` table by `salesperson_id` and calculates the total sales (`total_sales`) for each salesperson.

2. **Ranking with RANK()**:
```sql
RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(sales_amount) DESC) as rank
```
This part of the query calculates a rank for each salesperson based on their total sales. The salesperson with the highest sales gets a rank of 1. If two salespeople have the same total sales, they will get the same rank, and the next salesperson (with the next highest sales) will get a rank that skips the immediate next number. For example, if two salespeople are ranked 2nd, the next salesperson will be ranked 4th.

3. **Ranking with DENSE_RANK()**:
```sql
DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(sales_amount) DESC) as dense_rank
```
This part of the query also calculates a rank, but unlike `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()` doesn't skip any ranks. If two salespeople have the same total sales and get a dense rank of 2, the next salesperson (with the next highest sales) will be ranked 3rd.

4. **Result**: 
The output will be a list of salespeople along with their total sales, their rank based on `RANK()`, and their rank based on `DENSE_RANK()`.

The salespeople will be ordered based on the total sales in descending order (highest sales first), and the `rank` and `dense_rank` columns will show their respective ranks.

#### 3. **NTILE(n)**

Divides the result set into 'n' number of approximately equal parts.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2,
       NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY column3) AS quartile
FROM tablename;
```

**Example**:

Suppose we have the following table. 

| salesperson_id | total_sales |
|----------------|-------------|
| 1              | 300         |
| 2              | 200         |
| 3              | 400         |
| 4              | 100         |

Let's categorize salespeople into two groups based on their total sales, dividing them into the lower and upper halves. This can be useful for a quick bifurcation to understand which salespeople fall below the median in terms of sales and which ones are above the median.

```sql
SELECT salesperson_id, SUM(sales_amount) as total_sales,
       NTILE(2) OVER (ORDER BY SUM(sales_amount)) as quartile
FROM sales
GROUP BY salesperson_id;
```

The result would be:

| salesperson_id | total_sales | quartile |
|----------------|-------------|----------|
| 4              | 100         | 1        |
| 2              | 200         | 1        |
| 1              | 300         | 2        |
| 3              | 400         | 2        |

<summary>**Detailed explanation**</summary>
1. **Selection and Grouping**:

	```sql
	SELECT salesperson_id, SUM(sales_amount) as total_sales
	FROM sales
	GROUP BY salesperson_id;
	```
	This part of the query groups the `sales` table by `salesperson_id` and calculates the total sales (`total_sales`) for each salesperson.

2. **Dividing into Two Groups with NTILE(2)**:

	```sql
	NTILE(2) OVER (ORDER BY SUM(sales_amount)) as quartile
	```
	This part of the query assigns a group number (either 1 or 2) to each salesperson. The salespeople are divided into two groups based on their total sales, in ascending order. 
	
	- Group 1 will have the salespeople with the lower half of sales amounts.
	- Group 2 will have the salespeople with the upper half of sales amounts.
	
	Note: The term "quartile" in the column name might be misleading in this context since "quartile" usually denotes one of four equal parts. Given that `NTILE(2)` is used, it's splitting the data into two parts, which would be more accurately referred to as "halves" or "percentiles." A more appropriate column name might be "half" or "percentile."

3. **Result**:
	The output will be a list of salespeople, their total sales, and the group (1 or 2) they belong to based on their sales.
	
	
	The salespeople will be ordered based on the total sales in ascending order (lowest sales first), and the `quartile` column will indicate which of the two groups each salesperson falls into.

#### 4. **LEAD() and LAG()**

Allows you to access data from subsequent or preceding rows, respectively.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2,
       LEAD(column3, 1) OVER (ORDER BY column4) AS next_value,
       LAG(column3, 1) OVER (ORDER BY column4) AS prev_value
FROM tablename;
```

**Example**:

Imagine you have a sales team and you want to analyze the monthly performance of each salesperson. Specifically, you'd like to understand how the sales of each individual have changed from one month to the next.

Here's a sample dataset from the `monthly_sales` table:

| month       | salesperson_id | monthly_sales |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| January     | 1              | 100           |
| February    | 1              | 120           |
| March       | 1              | 110           |
| January     | 2              | 200           |
| February    | 2              | 210           |
| March       | 2              | 195           |

You want to determine the difference in `monthly_sales` for each `salesperson_id` from one month to the next.

##### Using `LAG()`

To achieve this, we can use the `LAG()` function to compare the `monthly_sales` of the current month with the `monthly_sales` of the previous month:

```sql
SELECT month, salesperson_id, monthly_sales,
       monthly_sales - LAG(monthly_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY salesperson_id ORDER BY month) as sales_difference
FROM monthly_sales
ORDER BY salesperson_id, month;
```

The result would be:

| month       | salesperson_id | monthly_sales | sales_difference |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| January     | 1              | 100           | NULL             |
| February    | 1              | 120           | 20               |
| March       | 1              | 110           | -10              |
| January     | 2              | 200           | NULL             |
| February    | 2              | 210           | 10               |
| March       | 2              | 195           | -15              |

This result table illustrates:

- For `salesperson_id` 1, sales increased by 20 units from January to February and then decreased by 10 units from February to March.
  
- For `salesperson_id` 2, sales increased by 10 units from January to February and then decreased by 15 units from February to March.

The `LAG()` function provides insights into the month-over-month sales difference, helping to quickly identify trends and performance changes for each salesperson.∫

### Window Frame Specification

Window frame specifications allow you to define which rows are included in the frame for each row's calculation. Common specifications include:

- **ROWS BETWEEN n PRECEDING AND m FOLLOWING**: Includes the 'n' rows before the current row and the 'm' rows after the current row.
  
- **ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING/FOLLOWING**: Includes all rows from the start to the current row or from the current row to the end, respectively.

### Example:

Calculate a moving average:

```sql
SELECT date, sales,
       AVG(sales) OVER (
           ORDER BY date
           ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING
       ) AS moving_avg
FROM sales_data;
```

## Summary

Window functions offer powerful tools for analytics and complex calculations in SQL without collapsing multiple rows into a single output row. They let you perform calculations across related data points, making them indispensable for time series analyses, rankings, and other analytical challenges. By understanding and effectively using window functions in MySQL, you can derive deeper insights from your data and perform advanced data processing tasks with ease.

## Learning Goals

Throughout the course of this activity, you will:

-  Interpret the structure and relationships within the SQL Murder Mystery database, recognizing the significance of each table and field in the context of the exercise.
- Utilize basic SQL commands and queries, such as SELECT, FROM, WHERE, JOIN, and GROUP BY, to retrieve and manipulate data from the database effectively.
- Analyze and correlate the data retrieved from different tables to identify potential suspects, clues, and relevant information pertaining to the murder mystery.
- Assess the results of various SQL queries, ensuring their accuracy and relevance in solving the murder mystery, and making adjustments as necessary to arrive at the correct conclusion.

## SQL Murder Exercise
For this exercise, you will put on your trench coat and hat as you will need to investigate a murder in SQL City. You will apply basic SQL concepts and learn how to handle a data model while solving a murder case! This game was created by Joon Park and Cathy He, and you can find all the details on [their website](http://mystery.knightlab.com).

To perform the exercise, you have two options. You can either work directly from their website, where you will find an interactive SQL statement interpreter. If you choose this option, it is recommended that you keep track of the queries and their outputs. Alternatively, you can go to [their GitHub](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/sql-mysteries), download the database, and run the queries from Jupyter.


### Statement
A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a **murder** that occurred sometime on **Jan.15, 2018** and that it took place in **SQL City**. Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database.

### Setup
For this activity you will work in groups of 3 and you will have approximately 1.5 hours to complete the exercise.


### Data Model

### Tips for Getting Started
- Start by examining the available tables and understanding the relationships between them.
- Craft your queries carefully to extract relevant data without overwhelming yourself with information.
- Think like a detective: correlate the data, follow the leads, and eliminate the suspects.
- Don't hesitate to refine and rerun your queries as you uncover more information.

### Collboration Tips
- Divide and conquer: Assign specific tasks or sections to each group member.
- Communicate clearly and regularly share findings and insights with your group.
- Collaboratively analyze the data and decide on the next steps.

## Reflection

Once you've identified the culprit, reflect on the process and the queries you've used. What challenges did you face, and how did you overcome them? What have you learned from this exercise that you can apply to real-world data analysis and problem-solving?


Good luck, Sherlock!

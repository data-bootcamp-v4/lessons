## Learning Objectives

The aim of today's lesson is to delve into Tableau's advanced functionalities, focusing on data organization and calculation tools. We will explore the creation of bins and calculated fields, as well as leverage quick table calculations and other user-defined table calculations. 

By the end of this session, you will be able to:

- Generate bins from numerical data columns, allowing for segmented analysis.
- Construct simple calculated fields using built-in functions to enhance data interpretation.
- Apply `IF-ELSE` logic in calculated fields to categorize data into user-defined groups.

## Hands On Lesson

The "Hands-On Lesson" section you provided is concise and informative, but it can be slightly enhanced for clarity and engagement. Here’s an improved version:

## Hands-On Lesson

Under the guidance of your instructor, this session is designed to provide practical experience in line with our learning objectives.

Together, we will:

- Integrate multiple measures and dimensions into our rows and columns to build complex data views.
- Learn the techniques to rearrange rows and columns effectively for more insightful data presentations.
- Master the manipulation of axes to fine-tune our visualizations.
- Apply simple quick table calculations to derive immediate analytical insights from our data.
- Explore the depth of table calculations for advanced data analysis.
- Utilize the "Create Bins" feature to segment numerical data efficiently.
- Implement `IF-ELSE` logic in calculated fields to categorize data into custom bins based on specific conditions.

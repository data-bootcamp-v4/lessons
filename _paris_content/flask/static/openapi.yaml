  title: Bechdel dataset API
  description: |-
    This API exposes the Bechdel dataset. It is a mix of two data sources:
    * The [Bechdel test dataset](https://bechdeltest.com): 
    * A subset of the [IMDB datasets](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/)
    
    The dataset contains around 10 000 movies (or TV show episodes), along with the people related to it (actors and actresses, film directors, etc.). Each movie is given a rating from 0 to 3 which corresponds to number of criteria that the movie fulfills.
    
    As a reminder, the Bechdel test, named after the American cartoonist Alison Bechdel, is a measure of the representation of women in a film (or other fiction). The tests asks whether the film:
    1. Has at least two (named) women characters
    2. Who talk to each other
    3. About something other than a man.

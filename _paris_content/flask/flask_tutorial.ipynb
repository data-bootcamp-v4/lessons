    "* With the `--port 8080` option, we chose the port we want to use. The port number must be unique on a machine (you cannot have two programs with the same port number). It is used from the outside when somebody connects to your computer, so that it knows which program to route the call to. This it why we concatenate the port number to the URL (or IP address),separated by a colon (e.g. `localhost:8080`). The default Web port is 80, so these two are equivalent: just `localhost` or `localhost:80`.\n",

On a side note, `__name__` is a special Python variable that contains the name of the module (here `app1` because the file is named `app1.py`). We pass this name to Flask, so that the name of the application is also `app1`.\n",
    "* Then, the line `@app.route(\"/\")` calls a method of `app` to declare a route. Actually, the `@` in Python sign means it is a _decorator_: it applies to the function that is defined just below and gives it some information. In this case, this is how we declare the mapping between the route `/` and the `hello_world` function.\n",
    "* The route `/` is a special route called the _root_ of the server. It means that by default, when you just enter the URL of the server followed by nothing (or just by `/`), the function mapped to it (here `hello_world`) will be called. It is the homepage of a website."

    "\n",
    "You will also add an `include_details` parameter which takes value `0` or `1` (default is `0`, i.e. skip the details) to let the user decide explicitly whether or not to include the people and the genres (but the Bechdel score will always be included). Indeed, the user may choose to skip the details to speed the query up.\n",

    "\n",
    "* To retrieve people and genres, you may be tempted to make one SQL query per film. It is possible but hightly suboptimal in terms of time (there is a large overhead for each query). So the best option is to make a single query using `WHERE movieId IN (%s, %s, %s, %s)` to retrieve all people / genres that match the list of movie IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Then you neeed to group the people (and genres) by movie ID, so that you can get them back all at once later on. To do so, we use `defaultdict` (more specifically `defaultdict(list)`). It is simply a dictionary but when a key does not exist, it acts as if it were there, with the default value `[]`. So you can always do `the_dict['somekey'].append(something)`."

    "\n",
    "You can copy-paste the contents of `openapi.yaml` into https://editor.swagger.io, which is a very nice tool to facilitate the creation and edition of Open API specification files (which is otherwise quite tedious...).

    "## 9. Final considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9.1. Possible improvements\n",
    "This is of course a simplistic API and a lot could be improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "We leave it as en exercice for you to practice :)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9.1.1. Other routes\n",
    "It would be nice to two other routes to retrieve people, the same way we did it for movies: `/people` and `/people/<person_id>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9.1.2. Filtering\n",
    "A nice feature to have would be to allow filtering in `/movies` (resp. `/people`) route. Instead of returning all movies (resp. people), the user could choose to filter on one oar multiple fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, a call could look like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "http://localhost:8080/movies?originalTitle=anatomie&year=2023\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, it remains to be defined how the filtering exactly bevaves. We could for instance use:\n",
    "* Exact match for integer fields like year,\n",
    "* And \"contains\" for string fields like originalTitle (in SQL it would be: `originalTitle LIKE %anatomie%`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9.1.3. Read-write\n",
    "Our API is read-only. But we may want to allow some people to add or update data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, we would create new routes with different _methods_. All the routes we created so far use the `GET` method. But there are other ones:\n",
    "* `POST` and `PUT` are used to create or update an object.\n",
    "* `DELETE` is used to delete an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP methods can be seen as \"words\" that we put before the URL. In other words, when you type `http://localhost:8080/movies/17009710` in your browser, under the hood, it makes this HTTP query:\n",
    "```\n",
    "GET http://localhost:8080/movies/17009710\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So the same route name `/movies/<movie_id>` can be reused with another method, e.g. to update the movie or create a new one if not exists:\n",
    "```\n",
    "POST http://localhost:8080/movies/17009710\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In Flask, it would look like:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@app.route(\"/movies/<int:movie_id>\", methods=[\"POST\"])\n",
    "def post_movie(movie_id):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9.2. Real-life production setup\n",
    "Before actually deploying it in production, there would be some mandatory steps to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "We mention the most important ones here, even if they are beyond the scope of this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9.2.1. Public binding\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, our API is \"bound\" to your local IP address (`127.0.0.1` aka `localhost`)\", which means it is only accessible from our computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we deploy it in production, we must \"open\" is to the outside world, i.e. \"bind\" it to the public IP address of your computer (or whatever server you deploy it to).\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, there is a generic IP address that stands for your public one: `0.0.0.0`. So you just need to run:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "flask --app app2 run --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9.2.2. Real backend (WSGI)\n",
    "You may have noticed a warning from Flask:\n",
    "> WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, the performance of the server we run with the `flask` command are quite poor and it is not reliable. It is optimized for debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "In real life, we would use another server (in Python they are called WGSI). A popular one is **Gunigorn**, which we highly recommend. More about it: https://docs.gunicorn.org\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9.2.3. HTTPS\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also have noticed that the API is in HTTP, not HTTPS. It means the connection between the server and the client is not encrypted, which is a *very bad practice*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before putting the API in production, we must enable HTTPS.\n",
    "\n",
    "This part would typically be handled by Gunicorn (but first, you would need to generate a certificate). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9.2.4. Authentication\n",
    "The _basic authentication_ we used (login and password) is not very secure. Indeed, everybody is using the same login and password.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the first mandatory step would be to create a separate login and password for each user. And then even switch to another type of authentication\n",
    "that is more secure, such as [OAuth2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9.2.5. API versioning\n",
    "What happens if you deploy your API and then decide to change a route (rename, change parameters, etc.)? Well, the code written by your client who calls your API brakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid this, it is important to version your API.\n",
    "\n",
    "What it simply means, is that instead of `http://localhost:8080/movies/17009710` you have something like `http://localhost:8080/v1/movies/17009710`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, you can have different versions in production at the same time. This gives some time to your clients to update their code. And eventually, you can shutdown the old versions, after having properly warned them."

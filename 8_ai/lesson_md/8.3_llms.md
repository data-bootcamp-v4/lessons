<br />

### Lesson Overview

This lesson provides an overview of Language Models and their applications. It explores the definition of Language Models, the key building blocks involved, and emphasizes the significance of Language Model APIs in accessing pre-trained models for integration into applications. You'll be introduced to various real-world applications, such as chatbots, language translation, content generation, and sentiment analysis. Additionally, ethical considerations surrounding Language Models, including concerns about inaccuracies, biases, and misinformation, are discussed to foster responsible and conscientious usage.


### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

1. Understand the concept of Language Models and their applications.
2. Recognize the importance of APIs for accessing Language Models.
3. Utilize Language Model APIs, such as GPT API.
4. Explore ethical considerations related to Language Models, including hallucinations and the concept of "stochastic parrots."

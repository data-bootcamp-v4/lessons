    "- Instance attributes are specific to each object (instance) of the class. They hold data unique to each instance.\n",
    "- Instance methods are functions defined inside the class, and they can access and modify instance attributes.\n",
    "- These are what we've seen until now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "    def bark(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"{self.name} says: Woof woof!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating two Dog objects\n",
    "dog1 = Dog(\"Buddy\", 3)\n",
    "dog2 = Dog(\"Max\", 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing instance attributes\n",
    "print(dog1.name)  # Output: Buddy\n",
    "print(dog2.age)   # Output: 2\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling instance method\n",
    "dog1.bark()       # Output: Buddy says: Woof woof!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, each Dog object (`dog1` and `dog2`) has its own `name` and `age` attributes. The `bark()` method can access and use these attributes to make each dog bark with its name.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Class Attributes and Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Class attributes are shared by all instances of the class. They store data common to all objects of the class.\n",
    "- Class methods are decorated with `@classmethod` and can access and modify class attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Circle:\n",
    "    pi = 3.14159\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, radius):\n",
    "        self.radius = radius\n",
    "\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def get_pi(cls):\n",
    "        return cls.pi\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating Circle objects\n",
    "circle1 = Circle(5)\n",
    "circle2 = Circle(8)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing class attribute\n",
    "print(circle1.pi)  # Output: 3.14159\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling class method\n",
    "print(Circle.get_pi())  # Output: 3.14159\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `pi` is a class attribute shared by all Circle objects. The `get_pi()` method is a class method that can access and return the value of `pi`. We call this method both using an instance (`circle1.get_pi()`) and the class itself (`Circle.get_pi()`), and both ways yield the same result."

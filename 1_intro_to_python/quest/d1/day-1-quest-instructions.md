# Day 1: Kickstarting the Python Analytics Quest

## Introduction

Kickstart your "Python Analytics Quest" today! Begin developing the intriguing text-based game, "Escape Room," using Python. The skills gained during the morning will fuel your project work which entails designing rooms, filling them with interesting items, and plotting an escape route.

## Daily Overview & Schedule

### Part 1: Reading the brief & Project Setup | 14:00 - 14:30

Set the groundwork for your project. Understand the project brief together, assign roles, and initiate your team's Google Colab notebook.

- Review project brief thoroughly
- Assign roles (Dev team and Research team)
- Start a [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.google/) (Select “New Notebook” and share it with your teammates)

### Part 2: Collaborative Development & Research Hour | 14:30 - 15:30

Split into two pairs: Dev team and Research/Innovation team.

**Dev Team:**

- Review **`sample-code.ipynb`** thoroughly.
    - [Click here to see sample code](https://github.com/data-bootcamp-v4/project-python/blob/main/sample-code.ipynb)
    - Note: Do not worry if you don’t understand all of the code today, the sample-code is provided for you to refer to throughout the week.
- Understand how Rooms and Items are defined and linked.
- Start constructing your own game structures.

Overwhelmed and don't know where to start? This is a tough challenge we know. But don't worry. We have included a working example for you to reference in which only 1 room (game room) is included. Read the example and make sure you understand it. Then you can expand on top of the example to code the rest of the rooms.

The provided example is just a Minimal Viable Product (MVP). It is fully functional but not bullet proof. You should be aware of its limitations while you are working and try to make your final product as robust as possible.

You can take the following steps throughout the week:

- Launch `sample-code.ipynb` and read through the file. Execute the code and play the game and try to make sure you understand what each line of the codes does.
- Create `main.ipynb` and copy the code from `sample-code.ipynb`. Expand the code following the example to create Bedroom 1.
- Test the game with Game Room and Bedroom 1. Make sure everything works and then work on Bedroom 2, and then the Living Room.
- Test the whole game. Try to make all kinds of inputs to make sure your game is rock solid and will not break.

**Research Team:**

- Read lesson in student portal: **Interpreting Python errors**
- Review the day's lectures to reinforce your understanding of Python data structures and flow control.
- You may create a document with the key points of research carried out to present to the Dev Team if you wish.

### Part 3: Interactive Knowledge Exchange | 15:30 - 16:00

Now, both teams present their progress and understandings (15 mins each pair). This phase is crucial for effective collaboration and progress for the quest.

**Dev Team:**

- Explain understanding of the code and game structures (from `sample-code.ipynb`)
- Present progress of the data structures designed so far. You may run the game in its current state as a demonstration.
- Share challenges encountered and solutions implemented.
- Answer queries from Research team.

**Research Team:**

- Share learnings about Python error messages. Explain how these could help when facing errors while coding.
- Recap the day's lectures with focus on game development.
- Propose improvements and fixes for the game code.
- Address queries from Dev team, ensuring everyone understands the information shared.

### Part 4: Application & Testing Phase | 16:00 - 16:30

In this final phase, the Research/Innovation team will apply what they've learned about the project, adjusting the code accordingly. Meanwhile, the Dev Team will review and test these changes.

**Research Team:**

- Apply your knowledge to the quest to identify and rectify potential errors in the code.
- Adjust code based on your review of the morning's lectures and self-guided reading.

**Dev Team:**

- Review the changes made by the Research/Innovation Team and challenge them as necessary.
- Test the game with the applied changes and ensure they fit seamlessly with the game's overall code.

Remember to communicate with your team members, make frequent saves, and refresh your work on Google Colab to ensure everyone is updated. Have a productive Day 1!

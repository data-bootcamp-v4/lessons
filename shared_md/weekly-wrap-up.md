In this session you will paticipate in a stand up with your classmates and teaching team to discuss how the week went.

The teaching team will guide the session and will ask you to reflect on topics such as:

- What were some challenges you faced
- Which topics are you finding difficult or need to spend more time reviewing
- How you found the lessons
- How you found the labs
